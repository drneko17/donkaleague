Welcome to my happy litte app using RIOT Games API built with Next.js

## Getting Started

First install required dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Generate your own RIOT development api key [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/) and put it into your .env.local file like this:

```
RIOT_API_KEY=RGAPI-1d0272fc-f4c3-4e24-9915-09a9831b2f37
```

Now you are all set and you can start the development sever:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the app on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
